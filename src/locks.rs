//! Lock strategies.
//!
//! # Safety
//! This crate requires that only one writer be active at a time. It is the caller's responsibility
//! to uphold th is guarantee.
//!
//! Note: if multiple writers are active, it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that each
//! writer is configured with an appropriate lock strategy. For example, mixing the `LockDisabled`
//! strategy with any other strategy is incorrect because it disables lock checks from one of the
//! synchronizers.
